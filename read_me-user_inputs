Welcome to DSGF framework - c99 version!

- The main DSGF code is dsgf_main.c, and it can be compiled simply running run_dsgf.sh in your terminal. 
More info about how bash scripting works for compiling codes: https://linuxconfig.org/bash-scripting-tutorial

- For this DSGF version, you should have installed the intel icc compiler, and source it before compile it in your machine.
The compilers and mkl were installed from https://www.intel.com/content/www/us/en/developer/tools/oneapi/hpc-toolkit-download.html?operatingsystem=linux&distributions=webdownload&options=offline
They can be sourced as: 
$ source /opt/intel/oneapi/mkl/2022.0.2/env/vars.sh
$ source /opt/intel/oneapi/compiler/2022.0.2/env/vars.sh 

However, DSGF does not need to be compiled when the user modify the simulation parameters. 
The user simply need to modify the appropriate .txt files, and run the code with the /.dsgf command in your terminal.

The user can modify: 
	-N_bulk_objects: number of thermal objects
	-N_subvolumes_per_object: number of subvolumes per thermal object, restricted by the .txt discretization files
	-N_omega: number of frequencies, currently the spectrum range is equally spaced  
	-T_calc: conductance temperatures
	-user_inputs: All other simulation modifications the user can make  

	-Options for user inputs in user_inputs.txt:
		material = SiC or SiO2
		geometry = thin-films or sphere
		discretization_thin_film = 2_thin_films_Lx02um_Ly1um_Lz200nm_d150nm_N640_discretization   --- only for thin films. This discretization is generated using the "discretization/Thin_film_discretization_SCRIPT.m" matlab code.
		d = 150.e-9
		radius = 50.e-9			--- only for spheres
		Lx = 200.e-9			--- only for thin films
		Ly = 1e-6			--- only for thin films
		Lz = 200e-9			--- only for thin films
		T1 = 301.
		T2 = 300.
		solution = D for direct OR I for iterative
		single_spectrum_analysis = N
		save_A_matrix = N
		save_G0_matrix = N
		save_SGF_matrix = N
		save_spectral_conductance = Y
		save_spectral_transmissivity = N
		save_power_dissipated = Y
		multiple_conductance_temperatures = N    //not implemented yet
