Welcome to DSGF framework - c99 version!

- The main DSGF code is dsgf_main.c, and it can be compiled simply running run_dsgf.sh in your terminal. 
More info about how bash scripting works for compiling codes: https://linuxconfig.org/bash-scripting-tutorial

- For this DSGF version, you should have installed the intel icc compiler, and source it before compile it in your machine.
The compilers and mkl were installed from https://www.intel.com/content/www/us/en/developer/tools/oneapi/hpc-toolkit-download.html?operatingsystem=linux&distributions=webdownload&options=offline
They can be sourced as: 
$ source /opt/intel/oneapi/mkl/2022.0.2/env/vars.sh
$ source /opt/intel/oneapi/compiler/2022.0.2/env/vars.sh 

However, DSGF does not need to be compiled when the user modify the simulation parameters. 
The user simply need to modify the appropriate .txt files, and run the code with the /.DSGF command in your terminal.
